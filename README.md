- Strong Typing with TypeScript(TypeScript must be used in every client side file),
- Create and style a README markdown file (README.md),

### Running the Program
Requirements:
- Visual Studio Code or other code editor
- A web browser
- Postman or another API testing program

Instructions:
- Clone to your local repository and open in code editor.
- run npm install to update the app dependencies.
- You will need to create the initial Admin account via Postman (or other API tester)
- Open Postman to run tests. [Postman Endpoint Tests](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11529668/TVRq1RDU) You'll need to Register and get a token to run certain tests.

## What's for dinner??

This is a JavaScript React app written in Typescript using the Model View Controller pattern. The premise is...
You have limited mobility and you primarily cook all your food. You buy groceries and store them in your home, but due to your limited mobility you aren't able to zip up and down the stairs to see what's available in the freezer in the basement. This is an app that will allow you to track the groceries you have, where you store them, and where you purchased them so you can keep track without having actually go see what is where.<hr/>

The app is divided into an admin and a user side. The user can edit their own account, look at vendors and locations, and they can add, get, and edit groceries. Only admins can add, edit, and delete, vendors and locations. To use the app go to [whats-for-dinner-client.herokuapp.com](whats-for-dinner-client.herokuapp.com). 
 Register a user. Once you've entered a few of your regular stores, you should move on to entering the locations in which you store your groceries. Following location, you can begin entering the actual groceries.
